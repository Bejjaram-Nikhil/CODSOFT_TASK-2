# CODSOFT_TASK-2

ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe vs AI
This is Task 2 of my CodSoft virtual Internship, where I've built a classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python with an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

You play as X or O, and the AI will counter every move with optimal strategy.

ðŸ¤– Features
1. Playable in the terminal
2. Option to choose player symbol (X or O)
3. AI uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient decision-making
4. Detects win, loss, or draw automatically
5. Clean board visualization

ðŸ§  Tech & Concepts
1. Python 3
2. Minimax Algorithm (for AI)
3. Alpha-Beta Pruning (for optimization)
4. Core logic implemented from scratch without external libraries
